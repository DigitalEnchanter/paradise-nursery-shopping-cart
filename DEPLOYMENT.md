# üöÄ GitHub Deployment Guide for Paradise Nursery

## Step-by-Step Deployment Instructions

### 1. Prepare Your GitHub Repository

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: `paradise-nursery-shopping-cart` (or your preferred name)
   - Make it public
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

2. **Get your repository URL**
   - After creating, copy the repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/yourusername/paradise-nursery-shopping-cart.git`)

### 2. Configure the Project for Deployment

1. **Update package.json** with your GitHub username and repository name:
   ```json
   {
     "homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/paradise-nursery-shopping-cart",
     "scripts": {
       "predeploy": "npm run build",
       "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Update vite.config.js** for GitHub Pages:
   ```javascript
   import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
   import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

   export default defineConfig({
     plugins: [react()],
     base: '/paradise-nursery-shopping-cart/', // Replace with your repo name
   })
   ```

### 3. Deploy to GitHub

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd e-plantShopping

# Initialize git repository (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit your changes
git commit -m "Complete Paradise Nursery shopping cart application"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/paradise-nursery-shopping-cart.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy
```

### 4. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section
4. Under **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**
5. Select **gh-pages** branch
6. Click **Save**

### 5. Access Your Deployed Application

Your application will be available at:
`https://yourusername.github.io/paradise-nursery-shopping-cart/`

## üîß Alternative: Manual Deployment

If you prefer to deploy manually:

1. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Upload the `dist` folder contents to your web hosting service**

## üìù Important Notes

- Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username
- Replace `paradise-nursery-shopping-cart` with your actual repository name
- The deployment process may take a few minutes to complete
- Make sure your repository is public for GitHub Pages to work (unless you have GitHub Pro)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **404 Error**: Make sure the `base` in vite.config.js matches your repository name
2. **Build Fails**: Check that all dependencies are installed with `npm install`
3. **Pages Not Loading**: Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
4. **Routing Issues**: For single-page applications, you may need to configure routing

### Quick Fixes:

```bash
# If deployment fails, try:
npm install
npm run build
npm run deploy

# If you need to redeploy:
git add .
git commit -m "Update application"
git push origin main
npm run deploy
```

## üéâ Success!

Once deployed, your Paradise Nursery shopping cart application will be live and accessible to anyone with the URL. You can share it in your portfolio, with friends, or use it as a demonstration of your React and Redux skills!
